<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Jerry George, a recent Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate from the Federal Institute of Science and Technology.</p>
<p>While my academic foundation is rooted in ECE, my passion lies in software development and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>Over the past few years, I’ve built solid programming skills in Python, along with a basic understanding of web technologies like HTML, and SQL.</p>
<p>I’ve applied these skills in projects such as Food Guard Pro, a smart mini-refrigerator for food monitoring, and MSL Sign Verse, a regional sign language learning model using Python.</p>
<p>I've also completed an internship in Embedded Systems with IoT, and taken on leadership roles, including serving as a class representative.</p>
<p>These experiences have strengthened both my technical and communication abilities.</p>

<p>While I may not yet be an expert in every area, I bring a strong learning mindset, adaptability, and genuine enthusiasm for technology.</p>
